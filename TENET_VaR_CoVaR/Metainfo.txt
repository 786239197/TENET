Description: 'Estimates the Value at Risks (VaRs) of 100 financial institutions
by using moving window estimation based on seven macro state variables. Then plot
the log returns of JP Morgan (black points), plot VaR of JP Morgan (red line) as
an example. As comparison, plot the estimated  CoVaR by using Single-Index Model
with LASSO (blue line) and estimated CoVaR by using linear quantile LASSO model
(green line)'

Keywords: tail, quantile regression, VaR, estimation, risk
