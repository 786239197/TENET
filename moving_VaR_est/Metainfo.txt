Published in: TENET: Tail-Event driven NETwork risk

Description: estimate the Value at Risks (VaRs) of 100 financial institutions 
by using moving window estimation based on seven macro state variables.
Then plot the VaR of JP Morgan as an example. As comparison, plot the estimated 
CoVaR by using Single-Index Modle with LASSO and estimated CoVaR by using linear
quantile LASSO model

Keywords: tail, quantile regression, VaR, estimation, risk, macro state variables,
